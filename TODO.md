* add contributors to home.clj
* Use CLJS on browser side to pr-str results back in s-expressions
* Switch views to use Enlive or other templating system, all that hiccup is

                     ;; because I've had such a frustrating time using Enlive, and 
                     ;; pleasant time with Hiccup
* Need a secure way of giving the CLJS compiler a *missing* tmp file to write to
