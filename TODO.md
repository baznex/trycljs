* Update all references from TryClojure to TryCLJS (or whatever)
  * Make note of origin, link back to tryclj + repo
* Call out to cljsc (stdin/stdout hacks? or API call?) to compile in compile.clj
* Use CLJS on browser side to pr-str results back in s-expressions
* Switch views to use Enlive or other templating system, all that hiccup is
  giving me hiccups.
